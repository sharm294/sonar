Purpose
=======

These testbenches are adapations of existing publically-available testbenches
as a way to show what Sonar can (and cannot) do and to show how different
testbenches can be adapted as Sonar testbenches.

Note: these adapted Sonar testbenches may be incomplete and have not (yet) been
verified.

The testbenches included here are:
- `UMass RCG HDL Benchmark Collection
  <http://www.ecs.umass.edu/ece/tessier/rcg/benchmarks/>`_
